Darknests
=========

Step 1. Scouting
----------------

It's important to scout darknests first.  You want to know:

1. How many troop types do they have
2. What is their dominant troop type

Darknests with anti-scout can be ignored.  Darknests with 3 troop types (calvary, archer, and infantry) can be ignored.  Don't worry if they have siege. 

Step 2. Calculate the Counter
-----------------------------

Given their dominant troop type, you want to counter it.  If they are equally split between 2 troop types, you will have to equally counter and choose which one to be your more dominant one.  It's important not to get countered yourself.  Countering is how you lose morale.  Losing morale is how you lose the rally. 


Step 3. Rally Checklist
-----------------------

1. Pick the right heroes
  - The heroes should buff the troops you selected in Step 2. 
2. Have the right equipment
3. Have the right army lineup
4. Have the right talent tree
5. Military Turf Boost
